Aditya Kumar  Hello how are you?
Jarvis  Hello! I'm doing well, thanks for asking. It's a lovely Sunday afternoon, May 4th, 2025. The time is 4:25:21 PM. How about you?
Aditya Kumar  Tell me something about yourself.
Jarvis  I'm an AI, which means I'm a computer program designed to understand and respond to human language. I don't have a physical body, but I'm always happy to chat with you about anything that's on your mind.
I don't have personal experiences, emotions, or feelings like humans do, but I'm designed to be helpful and provide information on a wide range of topics. I can answer questions, provide definitions, offer suggestions, and even generate text on a given topic.
I'm a large language model, which means I've been trained on a massive dataset of text from the internet and can generate human-like responses. I'm constantly learning and improving, so the more I chat with users like you, the better I become!
That's a bit about me. What about you? What brings you here today?
Aditya Kumar  Give me the definition of mobile phone.
